# Switches, transistors and memory

I am halfway through chapter 3 and most of it makes sense. The only thing I have had trouble with is the write/read pin, but more on that later.

- Transistors are tiny crystals of silicon that act as switches. A switch can be either on or off. It is a binary stated described by 1 and 0, where 1 is ON and 0 is OFF.

The transistor switch, and its support components are called a memory cell. The support components are not important so the transistor switch can be thought of as a black box.
		_________
		|	|
		|memory	|------o (input)
(select) 0------|cell	|
		|	|------o (output)
		|_______|


This works as follows: 

If you put a tiny voltage on its input pin and a similar voltage on its select pin a volate will appear and remain on its output pin.

In the beginning one chip help one transistor. Then we got more transistors to fit in a chip. First 8, then 16 and then multiples of 8 and 16.
Now plug-in circuit board memory modules are available with as much as two gigabytes in them (over 16 billion bits).
